# tiktaktoe
my python version of tiktaktoe, I was originally going to make it in flask before I went with javascript.
it uses a 2d list to represent the squares, use coordinates to place your marker
the opponent O is placed using the program
there are 3 files, opponent.py, checkwin.py and main.py, to use, run main.py
